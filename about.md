> I'm excited by any food that's prepared by someone who's proud of what they're doing, who puts a personal imprint on food. -- Anthony Bourdain

We're just regular people who love **good food**. We are not chefs nor are we restaurant owners, but we know what makes a great food experience (and we also know what makes an awful experience!) Our goal is to provide honest restaurant reviews from the worst to the best dining experiences wherever we go!

Mainly focused in Dallas/Fort-Worth (DFW) Texas, we've been lucky enough to eat at places all over the country, and we love trying new places! 

Want us to review a restaurant? Please contact us and let us know!

*Thank You for reading!*
